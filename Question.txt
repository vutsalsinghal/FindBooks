Write a program that reads in records from various input files and then outputs the list with command line options to sort or filter them.

We are looking for the following qualities: simplicity, maintainability, thorough tests, correctness, good engineering practices.

The format of the input files are,

pipe:
First name | Last name | Book Title | Book Publication Date

slash:
Book Publication Date/First name/Last name/Book Title

csv:
Book Title, Last Name, First name, Book Publication Date


Here is the program signature:

usage: books.py [-h] [--filter FILTER] [--year] [--reverse]

Show a list of books, alphabetical ascending by author's last name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --filter FILTER  show a subset of books, looks for the argument as a substring of any of the fields
  --year           sort the books by year, ascending instead of default sort
  --reverse        reverse sort

Here are some sample runs of the program

Please let us know the version of python that you use.  Only use the python standard library.  Attached are the input files.  Let me know if you have any questions.
